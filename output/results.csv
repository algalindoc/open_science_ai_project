paper_2.xml,Norm Growth and Stability Challenges in Localized Sequential Knowledge Editing,"This study investigates the impact of localized updates to large language models (LLMs), specifically in the context of knowledge editing -a task aimed at incorporating or modifying specific facts without altering broader model capabilities. We first show that across different post-training interventions like continuous pre-training, full fine-tuning and LORA-based fine-tuning, the Frobenius norm of the updated matrices always increases. This increasing norm is especially detrimental for localized knowledge editing, where only a subset of matrices are updated in a model . We reveal a consistent phenomenon across various editing techniques, including fine-tuning, hypernetwork-based approaches, and locateand-edit methods: the norm of the updated matrix invariably increases with successive updates. Such growth disrupts model balance, particularly when isolated matrices are updated while the rest of the model remains static, leading to potential instability and degradation of downstream performance. Upon deeper investigations of the intermediate activation vectors, we find that the norm of internal activations decreases and is accompanied by shifts in the subspaces occupied by these activations, which shows that these activation vectors now occupy completely different regions in the representation space compared to the unedited model. With our paper, we highlight the technical challenges with continuous and localized sequential knowledge editing and their implications for maintaining model stability and utility.",21,https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax
paper_3.xml,Finding Minimum Matching Cuts in H-free Graphs and Graphs of Bounded Radius and Diameter,"A matching cut is a matching that is also an edge cut. In the problem Minimum Matching Cut, we ask for a matching cut with the minimum number of edges in the matching. We give polynomial-time algorithms for P7-free, S1,1,2-free and (P6 + P4)-free graphs, which also solve several open cases for the well-studied problem Matching Cut. In addition, we show NP-hardness for 3P3-free graphs, implying that Minimum Matching Cut and Matching Cut differ in complexity on certain graph classes. We also give complexity dichotomies for both general and bipartite graphs of bounded radius and diameter.",13,No se encontraron enlaces
paper_4.xml,FinTSB: A Comprehensive and Practical Benchmark for Financial Time Series Forecasting,"Financial time series (FinTS) record the behavior of human-brainaugmented decision-making, capturing valuable historical information that can be leveraged for profitable investment strategies. Not surprisingly, this area has attracted considerable attention from researchers, who have proposed a wide range of methods based on various backbones. However, the evaluation of the area often exhibits three systemic limitations: 1. Failure to account for the full spectrum of stock movement patterns observed in dynamic financial markets. (Diversity Gap), 2. The absence of unified assessment protocols undermines the validity of cross-study performance comparisons. (Standardization Deficit), and 3. Neglect of critical market structure factors, resulting in inflated performance metrics that lack practical applicability. (Real-World Mismatch). Addressing these limitations, we propose FinTSB, a comprehensive and practical benchmark for financial time series forecasting (FinTSF). To increase the variety, we categorize movement patterns into four specific parts, tokenize and pre-process the data, and assess the data quality based on some sequence characteristics. To eliminate biases due to different evaluation settings, we standardize the metrics across three dimensions and build a user-friendly, lightweight pipeline incorporating methods from various backbones. To accurately simulate real-world trading scenarios and facilitate practical implementation, we extensively model various regulatory",14,"https://openreview.net/forum?id=gerNCVqqtR, https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID, https://doi.org/10.1145/2939672.2939785, https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2024/221MainTrack, https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2862908, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108218, https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848, https://openreview.net/forum?id=tEYskw1VY2, https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhae025, https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID, https://openreview.net/forum?id=sstfVOwbiG, https://openreview.net/forum?id=5BXXoJh0Vr, https://openreview.net/forum?id=bYRYb7DMNo, https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2017/366, https://openreview.net/forum?id=e1wDDFmlVu, https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/551, https://openreview.net/forum?id=7oLshfEIC2, https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i8.28770, https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2023.3310592, https://openreview.net/forum?id=dG1HwKMYbC, https://openreview.net/forum?id=vSVLM2j9eie"
paper_5.xml,A Nonlinear Extension of the Variable Projection (VarPro) Method for NURBS-based Conformal Surface Flattening,"In the field of computer graphics, conformal surface flattening methods have been extensively studied because they are useful in applications such as texture mapping, geometry processing, and mesh generation. However, most approaches aim to flatten a given input geometry while preserving the conformal property as much as possible. In other words, the resulting flattening is only as conformal as possible to the target surface. By contrast, this study focuses on a special class of surfaces that admits accurate conformal flattening. In this scenario, conformal flattening becomes a coupled problem: the input (or target) surface must be recursively refined while its flattening is being determined. Indeed, the uniformization theorem or the Riemann mapping theorem guarantees the existence of a conformal flattening for any surface, provided that the surface is simply connected and orientable. However, these theorems allow the conformal flattening to include singularities. If singularities are not permitted, then only a special class of surfaces admits conformal flattening-although many surfaces do fall within this class.",10,No se encontraron enlaces
paper_6.xml,Multi-Platform Autobidding with and without Predictions,"We study the problem of finding the optimal bidding strategy for an advertiser in a multiplatform auction setting. The competition on a platform is captured by a value and a cost function, mapping bidding strategies to value and cost respectively. We assume a diminishing returns property, whereby the marginal cost is increasing in value. The advertiser uses an autobidder that selects a bidding strategy for each platform, aiming to maximize total value subject to budget and return-on-spend constraint. The advertiser has no prior information and learns about the value and cost functions by querying a platform with a specific bidding strategy. Our goal is to design algorithms that find the optimal bidding strategy with a small number of queries.",4,"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-35389-6_2, https://doi.org/10.1145/3580507.3597707, https://doi.org/10.1145/3699824.3699838, https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2023.11, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2310.02879, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.12181, https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/, https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/884d79963bd8bc0ae9b13a1aa71add73-Abstract.ht, https://doi.org/10.1145/3366423.3380142, http://arxiv.org/ps/2502.19317v1"
paper_7.xml,IMAGECHAIN: Advancing Sequential Image-to-Text Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models,"Reasoning over sequences of images remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent models incorporate multi-image data during pre-training, they still struggle to recognize sequential structures, often treating images independently. This work introduces IMAGECHAIN, a framework that enhances MLLMs with sequential reasoning capabilities over image data by modeling visual sequences as a multi-turn conversation. In IMAGECHAIN, images are interleaved with corresponding textual descriptions to form a controlled dialogue that explicitly captures temporal dependencies and narrative progression. Our method optimizes for the task of next-scene description, where the model generates a context-aware description of an upcoming scene based on preceding visual and textual cues. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance on the nextscene description task -achieving an average improvement from 3.7% to 19% in SimRate, a metric that quantifies semantic similarity to human-annotated ground truths. Moreover, IM-AGECHAIN achieves robust zero-shot out-ofdomain performance in applications ranging from comics to robotics. Extensive experiments validate that instruction-tuning in a multimodal, multi-turn conversation design is key to bridging the gap between static image understanding and temporally-aware reasoning. 1",9,https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval
paper_8.xml,Provocations from the Humanities for Generative AI Research,"This paper presents a set of provocations for considering the uses, impact, and harms of generative AI from the perspective of humanities researchers. We provide a working definition of humanities research, summarize some of its most salient theories and methods, and apply these theories and methods to the current landscape of AI. Drawing from foundational work in critical data studies, along with relevant humanities scholarship, we elaborate eight claims with broad applicability to current conversations about generative AI: 1) Models make words, but people make meaning; 2) Generative AI requires an expanded definition of culture; 3) Generative AI can never be representative; 4) Bigger models are not always better models; 5) Not all training data is equivalent; 6) Openness is not an easy fix; 7) Limited access to compute enables corporate capture; and 8) AI universalism creates narrow human subjects. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of resisting the extraction of humanities research by computer science and related fields.

paper_9.xml,Poster: Long PHP webshell files detection based on sliding window attention,"Webshell is a type of backdoor, and web applications are widely exposed to webshell injection attacks. Therefore, it is important to study webshell detection techniques. In this study, we propose a webshell detection method. We first convert PHP source code to opcodes and then extract Opcode Double-Tuples (ODTs). Next, we combine CodeBert and FastText models for feature representation and classification. To address the challenge that deep learning methods have difficulty detecting long webshell files, we introduce a sliding window attention mechanism. This approach effectively captures malicious behavior within long files. Experimental results show that our method reaches high accuracy in webshell detection, solving the problem of traditional methods that struggle to address new webshell variants and antidetection techniques.",7,"https://github.com/nbs-system/php-malware-finder, https://n.shellpub.com/en, https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php, https://github.com/nbs-system/php-malware-finder, https://n.shellpub.com/en, https://github.com/w-32768/PHP-Webshell-"
